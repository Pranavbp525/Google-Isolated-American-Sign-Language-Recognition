# Google-Isolated-American-Sign-Language-Recognition
Google's Isolated American Sign Language Recognition(GISLR) is sign language recognition task posted by google as a competition in Kaggle. Our solution to this problem exploits the sequence structure of the data by using sequence models like transformer, gru, lstm. We also tried with vanilla ML models, although they yielded suboptimal results.
